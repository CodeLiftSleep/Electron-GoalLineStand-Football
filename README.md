# Electron-GoalLineStand-Football
Electron/Javascript/Angular UI


This project is going to the UI portion of Goal Line Stand allowing me to utilize the ease and powerfullness of Javascript/Angular/HTML and CSS to create a rich user interface and harnassing the power of the Chromium Embedded Framework to run the game in the Chromium Browser.

This project will be getting combined with the WPF GoalLine Stand Football project to utilize the CEF .Net Nuget package allowing us to merge both together in a single .Net project, utilizing the Chromium Embessed Framework for the UI and allowing seamless integration of Javascript/HTML/CSS and its many powerful frameworks into the WPF .Net project...

So we will have a Javascript/HTML/CSS UI front end and a C#/VB/WPF .Net backend combining the best of both worlds.
